# Martial_Arts_Robot
A maneuverable, robotic machine powered by a Raspberry Pi that uses LIDAR detection to autonomously navigate its environment. This machine is designed and programmed to simulate martial arts sparring for users who want a mobile martial arts training experience when by themselves. Built to support the weight of a punching bag, this machine navigates its surroundings while also keeping track of its user's position, maintaining a close, but safe, distance from them at all times.
